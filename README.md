### DESCRIPTION
##### X-Light is an open-source software that is written in Python with a graphical user interface. X-Light was developed to determine residual stress by X-ray diffraction. This software can process the 0D, 1D and 2D diffraction data obtained with laboratory diffractometers or synchrotron radiation. X-Light provides several options for stress analysis and five functions to fit a peak: Gauss, Lorentz, Pearson VII, pseudo-Voigt and Voigt. The residual stress is determined by the conventional sin2Ïˆ method and the fundamental method.
